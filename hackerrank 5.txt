FIND THE RUNNER-UP SCORE:

n = int(input())  # Number of participants (not really needed in the solution)
scores = list(map(int, input().split()))  # List of scores

# Convert the list to a set to get unique scores
unique_scores = list(set(scores))

# Sort the unique scores in descending order
unique_scores.sort(reverse=True)

# The second element in the sorted list is the runner-up score
runner_up = unique_scores[1]

# Print the runner-up score
print(runner_up)
